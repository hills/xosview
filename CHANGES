Changes since xosview-1.7.1
  BSDI support, courtesy of Tomer Klainer.

Changes since xosview-1.7.0
  Optimised scrolling graph to use XCopyArea.
  Fixes to linux diskmeter.
  Fixed all (I hope) linux code which parsed /proc/stat with too 
    small a buffer.
  
Changes since xosview-1.6.2
  Added a linux diskmeter which *should* be similar to the BSD version
    but which also differentiates between reading and writing. Linux 
    looks like it actually has more stats (per disk input/output) so 
    this could be expanded upon.
  Better *BSD support:  OpenBSD intmeter, FreeBSD diskmeter,
    NetBSD battery meter.
  Some Solaris support.

Changes since xosview-1.6.1
  Check for and set -D__SMP__ if the linux memstat module is built on a
    SMP system.
  New option to omit the meter captions (+-captions) added by
    Christian 'Dr. Disk' Hechelmann <drdisk@tc-gruppe.de>
  New graphing meter display mode added.
  Fixes to work with linux/alpha.
  BSD directories merged -- now a single bsd subdir shared by
    NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD.

Changes since xosview-1.6.0:
  Linux netmeter for kernels 1.1 and above no longer hangs after
    the packet count gets too high.
  Interrupt meter now supports priority settings under *BSD and Linux.
  Better UVM detection for *BSD.
  Code cleanup/removal of unneeded #include's for *BSD.

Changes since xosview-1.5.1, in no particular order:

  Linux netmeter does not need IPACCOUNTING for 1.1 kernels.

  Much better support for FreeBSD, thanks to Tom Pavel!

  Check for invalid meter priority of 0 added.

  NetBSD now supports the interrupt meter.

  Finally found the missing 'else' that was causing the net meter
    in particular to occasionally overwrite the label.
  
  Found 32-bit-wrap case that was also causing the netmeter grief.

  Bitmeter class drawing routine tweaked, usedLabel color changed
    to be the same as the `on' color for the bits.

Changes since xosview-1.5.0, in no particular order:

  On Linux the cpu meters will now show a seperate meter per cpu if 
    Jerome Forissier's kernel patch has been applied.

  Linux should now work out of the box with GNU libc (untested).

  The autoscale labels now work under Linux and HPUX.

  Early support for FreeBSD:  load, cpu, mem, and page meters.

  Now compiles with either BSD or GNU make (BSD make can not handle
    auto-depend with the current Makefile structure).

  Man page source code now uses lots of macros to make modifications easier.

Changes since xosview-1.4.*, in no particular order:

Linux memory and swap meters now will work with linux 2.0 or 2.1
  They will no longer work for pre 2.0 kernels.

All meters can now be disabled individually.

The overloaded 'network' resource has been deprecated, and replaced by
  'net' to enable/disable the NetMeter, and 'netBandwidth', which sets the
  initial maximum value for the meter.

Initial support for stipple masks has been added, primarily for users
  stuck with 1-bit monitors/display cards.  Try setting enableStipple
  true.  Please give us feedback on this, if you use it.  It needs
  some more work.

Initial support for the -name option for specifying an X resource
  `instance name' other than the default of `xosview'.  With the
  following .Xdefaults file:
    xosview*background:  blue
    xosviewFoo*background: black
  the command 'xosview' will have a blue background, and the command
  'xosview -name xosviewFoo' will have a black background, but all
  other resources will be from the default xosview resources.

New meters:
  PageMeter for Linux
  BatteryMeter for Linux
  DiskMeter for NetBSD

Improved drawing.

Improved usedLabels -- now the autoscale format can be used to
  automatically print a value in K, M, or G, as appropriate.  (Before,
  most displays showed percent use, instead of absolute values.)
