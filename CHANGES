Changes since xosview-1.9.0

  - Fix a bug where battery meter was not redrawn

Changes since xosview-1.8.3

  - Modify linux serialmeter startup to allow for a port number instead of
    True/False.  Patch provided by Horst Wente.

  - netIface support for NetBSD.  Patch from  Bernd Ernesti.

  - Move repository to Git

  - Merged patches from Debian distribution

  - Several bugfixes

  - Improvements to defaults

Changes since xosview-1.8.2
 - NFSDStats ans NFSStats Graph, Decay and UsedMode are now configurable

 - SunOS updates, compiles now cleanly with gcc 3.3.2

 - Fix for linux intmeter for interrupts > 16 thanks to John Adams

 - Small patch from Gunnar Wolf for lmstemp (change int to double)

 - Fix battery meter for case where lack of APM report -1%.  Thanks
   to Gunnar Wolf.

 - Allow netmeter to specify, via the Xresource xosview*netIface,
   which network interface it will monitor.  Patch thanks to Gunnar Wolf.

 - Add patch for additional cpu fields in linux for 2.6 kernel.  Patch thanks
   to Hendrik Fehr.

 - Add various pathes from the NetBSD project.  Pathes contributed by Roland
   Illig.

 - Fix bug 854215 (-v and --version still needed to connect to X server)

Changes since xosview-1.8.1
 - Applied sourceforge patch 927112 from Russell Reed which fixes
   the swapmeter when USESYSCALLS is defined.

 - Applied sourceforge patch 959433 which adds acpi support to
   the linux battery meter.

 - Applied a patch similar to the sourceforge patch 586184 submitted
   by Mark Guertin.

 - Linux diskmeter now uses vmstat and thus works with 2.6.
   But the units problem (block size) probably still remains.

 - Linux pagemeter should now work with 2.6 kernels

 - Merge in the fedora-2 nfs patch.

 - Merge in the fedora-2 strip patch.

 - Merge in the fedora-2 proc patch.

 - Merge in the fedora-2 s390 patch.

 - Merge in the fedora-2 non-i386 patch.

 - Merge in the fedora-2 linux-2.6 kernel (related) patch.

 - Add an autogen.sh script.  This script runs autoconf to create
   the configure script.

Changes since xosview-1.8.0

- Update linux port to build with gcc 3.2 and 3.3 (should still work
  with 2.95.

- Add -Wno-deprecated for gcc builds.  This avoids warnings about
  the new C++ header files.  This should be fixed for the next release.

- Change MAX_PROC_LENGTH in linux/cpumeter to 4096 to avoid
  an infinite loop with redhat 7.3

Changes since xosview-1.7.3

- Add Mike Butler's patch which fixes an infinite loop in
  the linux netmeter when a pcmcia card is ejected.

- Add Leopold Toetsch's linux lmstemp meter.

- Linux port (and maybe others) now works with gcc-3.0.4

- added IRIX 6.5 support

- Updated NetBSD support, based on patches from Bernd Ernesti, to
  use new CPU meter sysctl interface.

Changes since xosview-1.7.2

- IRQ rate meter for BSDs added.

- FreeBSD 4.* fixes by David O'Brien

Changes since xosview-1.7.1

- Linux now has a RAID meter.  See README.linux for how to set it up.

  BSDI support, courtesy of Tomer Klainer.
  Fixed memstat module for linux-2.2

  Changes from Thomas Waldmann (ThomasWaldmann@gmx.de)
- Fixed cosmetical bug in xosview:
  if you tried to make the xosview window height too small, it looked quite
  strange (because the height value for the meters got negative)

- Fixed cosmetical bug in disk meter:
  at first call, it displayed negative values, overwriting the "DISK" label

- Cosmetical fix:
  The titles were at x=0 - directly at the window border.
  Fixed it to show 1 pixel background between window border and title texts.
  Also moved "used" displays 2 pixels to the right, so that there is also 1
  pixel between the titles and the used display texts.

- Cosmetical fix: Xdefaults and Xdefaults.stipple file now looks nicer.

- Cosmetical fix: load meter sometimes went beyond the right border (I think
  when showing values >>20). Changed load meter scaling to be really dynamic
  (no upper bound for total, but total doesn't become less than 1.0).
  Changed "used" display to show load relative to 1.0 (so it now just shows
  the load value ;-).

- New feature: load meter now has not only a warning color (and threshold),
  but also a (higher) critical color (and threshold).

- Added info to disk meter problem documentation (see source):
  on my system, it showed only the half of the correct values, factor
  for SW-RAID5 md devices seems to be 2048 (md0), while standard ext2fs
  factor is 1024 on my system, too (hda).

  So there is a problem. Solution ???

- Fixed bitmeter to calculate graphics coordinates like fieldmeter

- MemMeter showed strange values when starting vmware (and having memstat
  module loaded): "used" memory got negative !! Looking at the values, I had
  the impression that "shared" memory is also counted as cache memory.
  I hopefully fixed that by subtracting shared from cache - looks better now.

Changes since xosview-1.7.0
  Optimised scrolling graph to use XCopyArea.
  Fixes to linux diskmeter.
  Fixed all (I hope) linux code which parsed /proc/stat with too
    small a buffer.

Changes since xosview-1.6.2
  Added a linux diskmeter which *should* be similar to the BSD version
    but which also differentiates between reading and writing. Linux
    looks like it actually has more stats (per disk input/output) so
    this could be expanded upon.
  Better *BSD support:  OpenBSD intmeter, FreeBSD diskmeter,
    NetBSD battery meter.
  Some Solaris support.

Changes since xosview-1.6.1
  Check for and set -D__SMP__ if the linux memstat module is built on a
    SMP system.
  New option to omit the meter captions (+-captions) added by
    Christian 'Dr. Disk' Hechelmann <drdisk@tc-gruppe.de>
  New graphing meter display mode added.
  Fixes to work with linux/alpha.
  BSD directories merged -- now a single bsd subdir shared by
    NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD.

Changes since xosview-1.6.0:
  Linux netmeter for kernels 1.1 and above no longer hangs after
    the packet count gets too high.
  Interrupt meter now supports priority settings under *BSD and Linux.
  Better UVM detection for *BSD.
  Code cleanup/removal of unneeded #include's for *BSD.

Changes since xosview-1.5.1, in no particular order:

  Linux netmeter does not need IPACCOUNTING for 1.1 kernels.

  Much better support for FreeBSD, thanks to Tom Pavel!

  Check for invalid meter priority of 0 added.

  NetBSD now supports the interrupt meter.

  Finally found the missing 'else' that was causing the net meter
    in particular to occasionally overwrite the label.

  Found 32-bit-wrap case that was also causing the netmeter grief.

  Bitmeter class drawing routine tweaked, usedLabel color changed
    to be the same as the `on' color for the bits.

Changes since xosview-1.5.0, in no particular order:

  On Linux the cpu meters will now show a seperate meter per cpu if
    Jerome Forissier's kernel patch has been applied.

  Linux should now work out of the box with GNU libc (untested).

  The autoscale labels now work under Linux and HPUX.

  Early support for FreeBSD:  load, cpu, mem, and page meters.

  Now compiles with either BSD or GNU make (BSD make can not handle
    auto-depend with the current Makefile structure).

  Man page source code now uses lots of macros to make modifications easier.

Changes since xosview-1.4.*, in no particular order:

Linux memory and swap meters now will work with linux 2.0 or 2.1
  They will no longer work for pre 2.0 kernels.

All meters can now be disabled individually.

The overloaded 'network' resource has been deprecated, and replaced by
  'net' to enable/disable the NetMeter, and 'netBandwidth', which sets the
  initial maximum value for the meter.

Initial support for stipple masks has been added, primarily for users
  stuck with 1-bit monitors/display cards.  Try setting enableStipple
  true.  Please give us feedback on this, if you use it.  It needs
  some more work.

Initial support for the -name option for specifying an X resource
  `instance name' other than the default of `xosview'.  With the
  following .Xdefaults file:
    xosview*background:  blue
    xosviewFoo*background: black
  the command 'xosview' will have a blue background, and the command
  'xosview -name xosviewFoo' will have a black background, but all
  other resources will be from the default xosview resources.

New meters:
  PageMeter for Linux
  BatteryMeter for Linux
  DiskMeter for NetBSD

Improved drawing.

Improved usedLabels -- now the autoscale format can be used to
  automatically print a value in K, M, or G, as appropriate.  (Before,
  most displays showed percent use, instead of absolute values.)
