This version of xosview is distributed from the following sites:

  http://www.pogo.org.uk/~mark/xosview/
  https://github.com/hills/xosview

The build no longer uses GNU autoconfig.  Control is via Makefile
variables. In general, you should be able to build on Linux using:

  $ make
  $ make install

To change the target prefix, use, for example:

  $ make install PREFIX=/usr

For more fine-grained control, see the Makefile for available
variables.

To specify a particular platform, use one of:

  $ make PLATFORM=linux
  $ make PLATFORM=bsd
  $ make PLATFORM=irix65
  $ make PLATFORM=sunos5
  $ make PLATFORM=gnu

Please see the README file for your platform for any special
instructions for running xosview on that platform.

The Makefile picks up additional variables from a .config file in the
source code directory.  You may prefer to use this if you are doing
several builds for testing and debugging.

Some platform variants require specific build flags; see the 'targets'
directory for preset .config files.

See the man page for information on the xosview display and how to
customize it.

See the COPYING file for licensing terms.
