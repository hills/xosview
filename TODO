* Do if(dolegends_) fix for loadmeter.cc for all ports.
* Add a version string, so that xosview -v prints out the version.

  Make xosview re-check resources when the resources are changed, 
    or when a signal is sent to it, or a key is pressed in it?

  Fix MeterMaker in the other ports to check for all meters, not 
    just load and serial.
